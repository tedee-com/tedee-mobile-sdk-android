Welcome to the Tedee Mobile SDK for Android! This comprehensive toolkit empowers developers to seamlessly integrate Tedee Lock functionality into their Android applications. Whether you're building a smart home app or enhancing access control features, our SDK provides the necessary tools to communicate with and control Tedee locks with ease, leveraging Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication protocol.

## Documentation

[Mobile SDK Documentation](https://tedee-com.github.io/tedee-mobile-sdk-android/)

## Features

- **Effortless Integration**: Incorporate Tedee lock functionality into your Android applications seamlessly.
- **Full Control**: Communicate with and operate Tedee locks, including [Tedee PRO](https://tedee.com/product-info/tedee-pro/) and [Tedee GO](https://tedee.com/product-info/tedee-go-best-keyless-access/), with comprehensive control options.
- **Efficient Communication**: Utilize Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for efficient device interaction, ensuring optimal performance and minimal energy consumption.

## Getting Started

Getting started with the Tedee Mobile SDK is straightforward:

### Installation

Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file.

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```gradle
dependencyResolutionManagement {
  repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
      mavenCentral()
      maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

Step 2. Add the dependency

```gradle
dependencies {
  implementation("com.github.tedee-com:tedee-mobile-sdk-android:v0.0.1@aar") { isTransitive = true }
}
```

Or if you are using Groovy instead of Kotlin:

```gradle
dependencies {
  implementation("com.github.tedee-com:tedee-mobile-sdk-android:v0.0.1@aar") { transitive = true }
}
```

### Configuration

To properly use sdk you will need:

- register your app with your app name and mobile public key (https://api.tedee.com/swagger/index.html#/Mobile/PostMobile, mobile public key is generated with `getMobilePublicKey()` See example app)
- provide lock serial number and device name (you can find it in Tedee app "Lock settings" -> "Information")
- get device public key, certificate and certificate expiry date (see example app how to get them from Tedee API)

When all required data is provided you can try to connect to the lock using `LockConnectionManager's` `connect(serialNumber: String, deviceCertificate: DeviceCertificate, keepConnection: Boolean = false, listener: ILockConnectionListener)` method.

## Example App
