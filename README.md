# Tedee Mobile SDK for Android [![](https://jitpack.io/v/tedee-com/tedee-mobile-sdk-android.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#tedee-com/tedee-mobile-sdk-android)

Welcome to the Tedee Mobile SDK for Android! This comprehensive toolkit empowers developers to seamlessly integrate Tedee Lock functionality into their Android applications. Whether you're building a smart home app or enhancing access control features, our SDK provides the necessary tools to communicate with and control Tedee locks with ease, leveraging Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication protocol.

## Documentation

[Mobile SDK Documentation](https://tedee-com.github.io/tedee-mobile-sdk-android/)

## Features

- **Effortless Integration**: Incorporate Tedee lock functionality into your Android applications seamlessly.
- **Full Control**: Communicate with and operate Tedee locks, including [Tedee PRO](https://tedee.com/product-info/tedee-pro/) and [Tedee GO](https://tedee.com/product-info/tedee-go-best-keyless-access/), with comprehensive control options.
- **Efficient Communication**: Utilize Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for efficient device interaction, ensuring optimal performance and minimal energy consumption.

## Getting Started

Getting started with the Tedee Mobile SDK is straightforward:

### Installation

Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file.

Add it in your settings.gradle or settings.gradle.kts if you use Kotlin:
```gradle
dependencyResolutionManagement {
  repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
      mavenCentral()
      maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

Or directly in root build.gradle if there will be a problem with sync build gradle:

```gradle
repositories {
    google()
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
```

Step 2. Add the dependency

```gradle
dependencies {
  implementation("com.github.tedee-com:tedee-mobile-sdk-android:1.0.0@aar") { isTransitive = true }
}
```

Or if you are using Groovy instead of Kotlin:

```gradle
dependencies {
  implementation("com.github.tedee-com:tedee-mobile-sdk-android:1.0.0@aar") { transitive = true }
}
```

### Configuration

To properly use sdk for lock already added to account you will need:

- register your app with your app name and mobile public key (https://api.tedee.com/swagger/index.html#/Mobile/PostMobile, mobile public key is generated with `getMobilePublicKey()` See example app)
- provide lock serial number and device name (you can find it in Tedee app "Lock settings" -> "Information")
- get device public key, certificate and certificate expiry date (see example app how to get them from Tedee API - [Documentation](https://github.com/tedee-com/tedee-example-ble-android/blob/master/README.md)

When all required data is provided you can try to secure connect to the lock using
```kotlin
  fun connect(
    serialNumber: String,
    deviceCertificate: DeviceCertificate,
    keepConnection: Boolean = true,
    secureConnectionListener: ILockConnectionListener
  )
``` 
method.

To properly use sdk for lock not added to account you will need:

- provide lock serial number. You can get it from [Tedee API](https://api.tedee.com) based on Activation Code. See example app how to get them from Tedee API - [Add lock documentation](https://github.com/tedee-com/tedee-example-ble-android/blob/master/ADD_LOCK_README.md)

When all required data is provided you can try to connect to the lock using 
```kotlin 
  fun connectForAdding(
    serialNumber: String,
    keepConnection: Boolean = true,
    addLockConnectionListener: IAddLockConnectionListener
  )
```
method.
